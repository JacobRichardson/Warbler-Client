# Warbler-Client

This project is the front end for a web application I created called Warbler.
<br />
<br />
## Installing

This is how to install the project. 

Note: You will also need the server up and running locally
for the application to work properly. Please visit https://github.com/JacobRichardson/Warbler-Server
in order to get the server up and running.

<br />

Start off by cloning the project locally.

```
git clone https://github.com/JacobRichardson/Warbler-Client.git
```

Navigate to the directory of the repo and run the following command.
```
npm install
```

Once the install is complete, use npm run start to launch the application.

```
npm run start
```

This should open a web browser on localhost:3000. The homepage of web application should be displayed.
